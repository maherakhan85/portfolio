      description: `Vocab is a web-based daily vocabulary builder designed to help users expand their English vocabulary in an engaging and manageable way. Each day, the app delivers 10 carefully curated words using interactive flashcards that include pronunciation, definitions, and tracking features to monitor learning progress. The platform emphasizes consistency over overload, using smart word scheduling to ensure learners receive fresh content daily while revisiting past words at spaced intervals. Its clean and responsive interface is powered by React.js and styled with modern CSS, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. Supabase is used as a secure and scalable backend for managing word data and user interaction logs. With pronunciation powered by the Web Speech API, learners can hear the correct way to say each word, reinforcing both auditory and visual memory.`,

      solutions: "To prevent word repetition, a client-side cache system using Local Storage was implemented, backed by a Supabase query that filters previously seen words. For offline functionality, local persistence of word data and user progress was added, ensuring that users could continue learning seamlessly. Animations and keyboard navigation were integrated to improve user engagement.",
